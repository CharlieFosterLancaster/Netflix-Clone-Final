# Neflix Clone

In this project I used the power of Flutter to create a web and android version of my own netflix clone. Flutter makes it really easy to create cross-platform apps and I believe it now more than ever before. With virtually the same code, with minor adjustments for different screen sizes we can create apps not only for android or ios, but also for other platforms such as Desktop, Televisions and even SmartWatches! I used Firebase as backend.

## Getting Started

You are free to pull the project and customize it as per your own needs. You will have to integrage Firebase. For Firebase integration, refer to this page:-
